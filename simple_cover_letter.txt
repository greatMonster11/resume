Dear HR Department,

With a formal background in both front-end and back-end development, I am looking
transition into the place where I could play both in the same role. I belive my skills
and background make me a good fit for the position of Full-stack Engineer.

Having used your product, I am already knowledgeable about your brand and your offering. I have
passionate about music, so I would bring my passion and knowledge to promoting your product
to another level with greater user experiences.

I understand that my current year of experience is not quite enough, but I believe that  with the
ability on doing something does not just depend on years of experience. During my last jobs,
I have learned a lot from working in a professional culture, how you can follow the internal
documentation and solving problems by using my own investigation skills and so on.


I believe that the skills I developed in previous positions have prepared me for this
opportunity with your firm. My experience with Javascript and the ability to learn for
new things make me a considerable candidate for this opening.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Phuoc Thanh
